## Self-Assesment 

The project contains a command line battleships game and also a game UI with the help of Flask 
To play in the command line you have to call the simple_game_loop or the ai_opponent_game_loop function and run it 



## Features
The function "difficulty" allows to choose between 3 difficulty levels : easy, hard, impossible

To change the difficulty you have to change the "dif" parameter in the difficulty function

The function "display_board" makes the board more readable in the console, but it only has testing purposes and no real impact on the game


## Running the game
run main.py
open a browser and search for 127.0.0.1:5000/placement
There click to place the battleships or press "r" to rotate them 
On the next page click on a cell to shoot onto it
After the game has ended restart the script to play again
